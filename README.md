This is my personal website 

Run npm install followed by npm start

It is hosted on github pages and then the domain is on google domains

To make sure the updated version is up git push and then make sure the pages is the latest and then refresh the domain server

Make sure to run npm run deploy before pushing over to github so that the newest version can be observed
